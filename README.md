Citation: Buckley LB and Kingsolver JG. Functional resurveys and models reveal the interplay of plasticity and evolution of Pierid butterflies in response to recent climate change

Brief abstract: The extent of contemporary evolution will be an important determinant of the organismal and biodiversity consequences of climate change. Organisms can respond to climate change via tracking through space or time, phenotypic plasticity, or evolution. A key unknown shaping these interacting responses is whether plasticity facilitates or hinders evolution. We synthesize two resurvey projects for Pierid butterflies that evaluate the interplay of plasticity and evolution in responses to climate change. The temperature dependence of larval development and growth constitutes an important mechanistic link between phenotypes and the environment. Adult wing melanization, which influences the absorption of solar radiation to alter body temperature and flight activity, responds plastically to development environments. We examine shifts over recent decades in microclimate experienced by larval and adult Pierid butterflies. We assess the implications of the microclimate shifts for selection on the temperature sensitivity of larval feeding rate. We estimate selection for warmer thermal optima for feeding, particularly in response to spring warming. Selection estimates partially correspond to observed evolution, but we also detect some evolutionary surprises. The research highlights the importance of considering interacting organismal responses to climate change.
